This is the original model files in the NetPyNE simulation environment for the paper:

Theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in a hippocampal CA1 microcircuit

by Adam Ponzi, Salvador Dura-Bernal, and Michele Migliore

USAGE:

1. Compile the mod files on the command line with 'nrnivmodl mechanisms'.

(Optional) Install the NetPyNE simulation environment (http://netpyne.org/install.html)

2. Run the code directly with the command line 'python t42_init.py'
